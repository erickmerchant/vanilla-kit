# vanilla-kit

A tiny front-end framework using a fluent interface for constructing UI. It also has shallow reactivity. Less than **2 kB** minified and compressed. Use or download it from a CDN like [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/erickmerchant/vanilla-kit/lib.min.js) and add it to your import map.

## API

### _lib.js_

Where all the core functionality resides. If you wouldn't really use the framework without a feature then it's in lib.js. Otherwise it will be in its own module.

#### watch(object)

Pass it an object (arrays supported) and it returns the object wrapped in a proxy that will track reads of properties in _effects_, and writes/deletions will rerun those _effects_.

#### effect(callback)

Pass it a callback to do operations that should get rerun when _watched_ objects are changed. It's for things not covered by the _element_ API. Eg. setting localStorage or calling methods on DOM elements. Only properties that are later changed will trigger a rerun. Internally this same method is used anywhere a callback called an _effect_ is allowed.

#### html, svg, math

These are proxies of objects that return functions called _tags_ that when called return an instance of `Element`. There are three because HTML, SVG, and MathML all require different namespaces when creating an DOM element.

#### Element

Usually you won't use `Element` directly unless you want to write your own methods. It is exported so that methods can be added to it's prototype. You can also do `new Element(element)` to wrap a DOM element in the fluent interface.

#### element.deref()

A method on `Element` instances that returns the underlying DOM element.

### _define.js_

Contains the API for creating Custom Elements.

#### define(name)

Pass it the name of your Custom Element. It returns a definition that is also a _tag_.

#### definition.connected(callback)

The passed callback is called in the Custom Element's `connectedCallback`.

#### definition.disconnected(callback)

The passed callback is called in the Custom Element's `disconnectedCallback`.

### _element/*.js_

Every module in the element directory adds a method to the `Element` prototype. Import the file to add the method. They don't export anything. For instance to use `styles(styles)` import `element/styles.js`.

#### element.prop(key, value)

Set a property. The second parameter can be an _effect_. Returns the _element_ for chaining.

#### element.attr(key, value)

Set an attribute. The second parameter can be an _effect_. Returns the _element_ for chaining.

#### element.classes(...classes)

Set classes. Accepts a variable number of strings and objects. With objects the keys become the class strings if their values are true. Values can be _effects_. Returns the _element_ for chaining.

#### element.styles(styles)

Set styles. Accepts an object where the keys become the style properties. Values their values. Values can be _effects_. Returns the _element_ for chaining.

#### element.aria(attrs)

Set aria attributes. Accepts an object where the keys become the aria attribute names. Values their values. Values can be _effects_. Returns the _element_ for chaining.

#### element.data(data)

Set data attributes. Accepts an object where the keys become the dataset keys. Values their values. Values can be _effects_. Returns the _element_ for chaining.

#### element.on(name, callback, options = {})

Set an event handler. Has the same signature as `addEventListener` but the first parameter can also be an array to set the same handler for multiple event types. Returns the _element_ for chaining.

#### element.nodes(...children)

Set the children of an _element_. Each child can be a string, a DOM element, an _element_, an array, or an _effect_. Returns the _element_ for chaining.

#### element.text(text)

When you need to set one text node, use `text` instead of `nodes`. The parameter can be a string or an _effect_. Returns the _element_ for chaining.

#### element.shadow(mode = "open")

Attaches and returns a shadow, or returns an existing one. The returned shadow DOM instance is wrapped in the `Element` API.

#### element.observe()

Returns an observer that uses a `MutationObserver` backed way to read attributes, and query descendants. When methods of the returned `observer` are used in an _effect_ the effect will be rerun when a mutation happens.

#### observer.attr(key)

Read an attribute.

#### observer.find(query)

Find children.

### _element/each.js_

Each is a way to create reactive lists.

#### each(list)

Entry point for this API. Pass it a _watched_ array. Returns a _collection_ that is iterable, having a `Symbol.iterator` method.

#### collection.filter(callback)

The callback will be called for each item in the _collection_. Return a boolean to move onto the map step.

#### collection.map(callback)

The callback will be called for each item in the _collection_ that passes the filter step. It should return an _element_. It is passed an object that contains `item`, the _collection_ item, and `index` its index. Do not use destructuring assignment with the `item` between _effects_, because they will not be rerun if the item is swapped out since the callback when called in `nodes` is only called once per index. This avoids destroying DOM elements only to rebuild them with new data.

### _prelude/min.js_

For convenience, a module that exports all of lib and imports attr, nodes, on, prop, and text. The minimum you'd need to get started.

### _prelude/all.js_

Exports all other exports, and imports all element/*.js files. Probably only use this for demos.

## Inspiration

A lot of the API is inspired by Rust and its ecosystem. The rest is the latest iteration of ideas I've had since around 2015. I need to mention the following as inspiration though.

- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
- [Ender](https://github.com/ender-js/Ender)
- [HyperScript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript)
